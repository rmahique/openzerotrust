## Open Zero Trust

# Overview

Open Zero Trust is a Full Lifecycle Container Security platform, delivering cloud-native security with uncompromising end-to-end protection, from DevOps vulnerability protection to automated run-time security, featuring a true Layer 7 container firewall that can block zero days and other threats.

With the Open Zero Trust (OZT) platform, DevOps, DevSecOps, and Security teams have the tools they need to secure the entire container pipeline, from Build to Ship to Run, automatically.

## History

The Open Zero Trust project started as NeuVector in 2015 by industry veterans Fei Huang and Gary Duan. Fei’s background is in security and virtualization from VMWare and Trend Micro, while Gary’s background is in security at Fortinet and Cisco.

NeuVector, previously a closed source product, has been in production at over a hundred enterprises, securing docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift, Rancher, Mirantis and public cloud (EKS, AKS, IKS, GKE etc) deployments. 
A large cloud service provider has stress tested the NeuVector architecture in a 1,000 node cluster successfully. 

Initially focused on run-time security of production workloads, the product has expanded to provide security across the lifecycle of containers, from build-phase scanning to admission controls and production security. The cloud-native zero trust security platform has had several major releases and is currently in its fifth generation, and there are several patents granted in the areas of network security and automated learning in a container environment.
In October, 2021, SUSE acquired NeuVector and announced plans to open source the software.


## Architecture

<img align="center" src="images/ozt_arch.png" />


There are four main components:

+ [Manager](https://github.com/openzt/manager) - Security Center Admin Console for OZT Container Security Platform.
+ [Scanner](https://github.com/openzt/scanner) - Vulnerability scanner for OZT Container Security Platform.
+ [Enforcer](https://github.com/openzt/neuvector) - The Enforcer is a lightweight container that enforces the security policies.
+ [Controller](https://github.com/openzt/neuvector) - The Controller manages the OZT Enforcer container cluster and provides REST APIs for the management console.
